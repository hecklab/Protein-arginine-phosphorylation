# Protein-arginine-phosphorylation



## Usage

The code is embedded in RMarkdown documents, one per analysis. We have added an RStudio project file for convenience.

In order to 'knit' these files, you will need to download the data from the publication. 
Obtain the *MQ_output_txt.zip* file from the PRIDE repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) with identifier PX....... and extract the files
in the same folder as the rmarkdown documents. The R code should be able to find the files from there.
